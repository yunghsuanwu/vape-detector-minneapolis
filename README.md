This repository serves as an appendix to the report "Selling Safety: Assessing Corporate Promotion of AI-Powered Vape Detectors in School Bathrooms."

# About the report
Vape Detection Technologies (VDTs) are AI-powered systems increasingly used in US schools to monitor bathroom environments for e-cigarette vapors, prohibited substances, and behaviors that may indicate vaping. VDT systems comprise arrays of sensing devices installed in school bathrooms, locker rooms, and other “private” spaces in schools, programmed to collect and feed data into an AI-driven backend platform for analysis. While VDT systems do not collect visual data, manufacturers claim the devices have the ability to monitor for aggression and bullying, in addition to air quality and disease transmission in schools using built-in sensors. The systems also allow school officials and law enforcement to cross-reference device alerts against data from hallway CCTV, electronic hall passes (E-Hall Pass), and other data to circumstantially identify students allegedly involved in vaping incidents. 

The intention of this report is to build awareness of the use of VDTs; promote critical examination of manufacturers’ claims of effectiveness; and to propose a set of queries and parameters for VDT hardware and systems testing. Altogether, the report is part of a larger intention to document and examine the impact of the experimental use of novel data- and AI-driven technologies in complex social settings with vulnerable populations.

# About this repository
This repository contains the raw materials and data used as part of the analysis in the report. You could find the following:

## HALO marketing materials
In the report, we referenced many of the VDT provider HALO’s marketing materials (e.g., HALO marketing material X). In the file [HALO-marketing-materials.zip](HALO-marketing-materials.zip), we provide the screen captures of our references on HALO’s own pages (with computer screen time showing the date of capture). We also archived the relevant webpages and provided links to them in an Excel sheet.

## HALO VDT data
In the report, we showcased a preliminary data analysis of the HALO VDT’s performance at Camden High. We hereby provide the original data acquired via an open record request made by our colleagues at the NOTICE Coalition and kindly provided to us. 

The raw data we received was in the PDF format and can be found in the folder halo-report-data-pdf. We then converted it into the CSV format, which can be found in [halo-report-data-csv](halo-report-data-csv). 

The VDT data came from four schools: Andersen Middle, Anwatin Middle, Camden High (called Henry High in the dataset), and Roosevelt. Data spans from September 2024 to mid-April 2025. 

We also provide the Jupyter Notebook [halo_dateexploration.ipynb](haloreport_dataexploration.ipynb) containing the data exploration and analysis we’ve performed for the report.

## Social media data
In the report, we also included quotes and captures from social media data where online users–especially students–took to the internet to discuss HALO VDTs. Acknowledging that this is yet a comprehensive survey of the broad social media space, we provide what we have discovered during the time of our studies in [social-media-data.xlsx](social-media-data.xlsx).
